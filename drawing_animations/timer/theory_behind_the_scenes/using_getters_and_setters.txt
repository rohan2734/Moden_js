* here for getting the timeRemaining, we can do a getter for timeRemaining
* and without actually using a function decleration , we can get the timeRemaining from the getter of timeRemaining
* as 
 tick = () => {
    const timeRemaining = this.timeRemaining;
    this.timeRemaining =timeRemaining - 1; 
  }
* here , we want other developers to think it as a property of the instance of the class
* also 
* we can create a setter for timeRemaining using set keyword 
* and without setting the value by passing a argument to the timeRemaining function
* we can assign it without a argument, but like a similar variable .

* we are using getters and setters to hide the complexity of how we are getting the timeRemaining and setting it.

tick = () => {
    // const timeRemaining = this.timeRemaining;
    // this.timeRemaining =timeRemaining - 1;
    
    this.timeRemaining = this.timeRemaining - 1;
  }

* it can also be done in one line as, 
* this.timeRemaining in the RHS is calling the getter function to get the value, and
* in the LHS, we are setting the value by using the setter
