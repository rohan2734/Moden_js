start = () => {
    setInterval(this.tick,1000); 
  }
  
  tick = () => {
    console.log("tick");
  }

* here , when we referesh the page, the setInterval(this.tick,1000); 
* the setInterval doesnt start immediately, instead it waits for one second and then starts counting.
* but this is not a good sign, bcz, users want it to start immediately
* so we will add as 

start = () => {
    this.tick();
    setInterval(this.tick,1000); 
  }

* now for pausing it,
* we actually a timer from setInterval();
* we receive a  unique id,
