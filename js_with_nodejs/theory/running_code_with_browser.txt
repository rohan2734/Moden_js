* when we have two scripts, one with message, and a 
  const message="hi"; defined in that message.js file
* and another file, with index.js, with console.log(message);
* then we would see the message as "hi", when it is in index.html

* but in node, it doesnt happen, variables are not shared between the files
  instead , if we want to share ,we should use module.exports
