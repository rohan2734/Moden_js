* option1

* in option1, we try to select the div with a class name,
* setup a event listener of the input, 
* we would take the results, and generate the options
* and throw the anchor tags or results in the div of class dropdown content

* this would be obivous, but there is also other way/
* but the draw back, is our js code would not work correctly, if we dont have the input element.
* likewise, if we mispelled the class names, or we moved the classes, then the application would be broken


* option 2

* we are going to have less html.
* and we are going to rely on js code, for creating the html, elements
* this is the flexible approach, because we could use our autocomplete widget , at other place in the files.
